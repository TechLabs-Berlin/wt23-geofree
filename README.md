# Geofree | TechLabs Berlin 2023

## Summary

🗺️ _"map app of freebies"_

Geofree is a platform designed to facilitate the donation and collection of items left in the streets of Berlin. Geofree is based on the Berliner culture of preserving and re-using everyday objects found on the sidewalk, and its mission is to reduce waste and clutter.

Geofree accomplishes this through following features: a map view with marked locations of donated items, search and browse functions, and a page allowing item upload. The website also includes an item recommendation system, which suggests items to users based on their chosen categories and the ranking of posts' date, views, and likes. Additionally, users can provide feedback by flagging items as unavailable.

With Geofree, users can easily discover and collect donated items, help reduce waste of useful items and keep the streets of Berlin clean.
